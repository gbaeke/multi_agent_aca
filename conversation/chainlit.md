Welcome to the **Contoso Assistant** - your intelligent companion for exploring and understanding Contoso projects! This AI agent is specifically designed to help you discover, learn about, and get detailed information on various Contoso initiatives and technologies.

## What Can I Do? 🎯

The Contoso Assistant specializes in:

## My Capabilities 🔧

### Knowledge Sources
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: I can search through Contoso's project documentation and knowledge base
- **Web Search**: I can find the latest information about technologies and concepts mentioned in projects
- **Multi-Source Research**: I combine multiple information sources to give you comprehensive answers

### Smart Research Process
When you ask about a project, I:
1. First search the Contoso knowledge base for project details
2. Then research any mentioned technologies using web search
3. Provide you with a complete picture combining both sources

You'll see visual **Steps** in the interface showing exactly which tools I'm using in real-time!

### Visual Tool Feedback 👁️
As I work on your request, you'll see interactive steps appear in the chat showing:
- **web_and_rag - search_knowledge**: When I'm searching the Contoso project database
- **web_and_rag - web_search**: When I'm researching technologies or concepts online
- **Real-time progress**: Watch as each tool executes and completes

This transparency helps you understand exactly how I'm gathering information for your request.

## Tips for Best Results 📚

### ✅ Do Ask:
- Specific questions about Contoso projects
